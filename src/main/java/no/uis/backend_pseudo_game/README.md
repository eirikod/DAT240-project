# Package: backend_pseudo_game

### This package has no relation to the main application code.
In this package we will make the structured code for the game on the back-end.
It will have no effect on the main application and is used only to create the code for the game (such as party management and the game itself). 
We will make dummy classes in the nested package ``main.java.no.uis.backend_pseudogame.dummy`` to simulate connecting players to the game or more if need be.

The purpose of this package is to create the functional game code without conflicting/depending on the front-end until we are ready to integrate it into the main application.
